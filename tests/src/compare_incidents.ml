let doc = "Compares incidents in two files.

invocation: ./compare-incidents check-name real incidents exact expected

If the exact flag is set then incidents in two files must be
be the same, i.e. all the incidents from one file are present
in another and vice versa.

Otherwise, all the real incidents must be a subset of the
incidents we are checking, i.e. false positives are permitted,
but no regression is allowed.

Incidents are compared by the addresses of their locations and
by theirs name. Thus, if an incident has three locations, then
a corresponded incident considered as an equal one if it has
the same number of locations with the same addresses as the first one.

The status of the comparison is one of the PASS | FAIL | XFAIL.
The latter one is assigned if incidents don't match each other and
'expected' flag is set."
